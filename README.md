# Bayesian maximum variance inclusion

Python and Jupyter notebook implementations of the BMVI sampling method with ridge regression (regularized least squares, RLS) prediction method. The BMVI method is compared against simple random sampling with a synthetically generated data via Gaussian mixture model function. Prediction performance estimation and hyperparameter selection is implemented via 10-fold cross-validation.
